/**
 * The PrivateTRScontract is a private version of the TRS contract that is used solely by The Aion
 * Foundation, for the foundation to lock its funds away over a number of months, ensuring continued
 * commitment to the project.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the public-facing TRS contract, the logic for this private TRS contract is bound inside
 * a single class. This is for 2 reasons: there are fewer supported operations for the private TRS
 * contract, and user-friendliness is not a concern here.
 *
 * <p>The PrivateTRScontract may be thought of as a parent class for the public-facing TRS contract
 * in that the latter calls this contract to perform any supported operations it needs.
